- Bookshelves can be accessed by the URI biblio/bookshelves (HTTP method GET) which will return an XML representation of all the bookshelves stored in the server that contains the keyword passed as a parameter in their name (it can be empty; the keyword can be null, in that case it will return every bookshelf).

- A bookshelf can be created (HTTP methods POST) by the URI biblio/bookshelves and it will return the bookshelf created if the creation has been completed without error; a conflict error (409) if a bookshelf with the same name already exists (therefore assuming there can not be two bookshelves with the same name); a bad request (400) if the bookshelf passed with the POST is not properly formatted.

- A particular bookshelf can be accessed/deleted (HTTP methods GET/DELETE) by the URI biblio/bookshelves/{name}, {name} being the name of the bookshelf (which uniquely identifies a bookshelf in the server). If the bookshelf does not exist return a 404 error, otherwise return the bookshelf (or an OK if we wanted to delete the bookshelf). Notice there is no PUT/PATCH method that can be used in this URI, so the name of the bookshelf can not be changed after the creation (and of course neither the other parameters), that's because (as stateed before) we are under assumption that the name of the bookshelf identifies it uniquely on the server (much like an ID), so there is no point in giving the possibility to change it. Items can be inserted/deleted in another way.

- An item can be inserted in a bookshelf by the means of a POST on the URI biblio/bookshelves/{name}, {name} being the name of the bookshelf in which the item will be inserted. It can return OK if the insertion has been completed without errors, 404 if the bookshelf does not exists, 400 if the item is not well formatted. In the bookshelf only the URI of the item is saved.

- An item can be deleted in a bookshelf by the means of a DELETE on the URI biblio/bookshelves/{name}/{id}, {id} being the id of the item to be deleted. If the item or the bookshelf does not exists, it return a 404, else return OK and the item is deleted from the bookshelf {name}.

- To access the number of reads of a particular bookshelf, the method GET on the URI biblio/bookshelves/{name}/n_read can be used. It will return only the number of reads, not the entire bookshelf or other data. The number of reads of the bookshelf {name} are updated every time that bookshelf is accessed directly (GET URI biblio/bookshelves/{name}) or indirectly (GET URI biblio/bookshelves with a keyword that return ALSO the bookshelf {name}).
